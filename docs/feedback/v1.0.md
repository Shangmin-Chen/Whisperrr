3. transcription complete is redundant
4. transcription complete should be title and a whole block
5. language should spell the whole thing out rather being the abbreviation "english" rather than "en"
6. buttons like copy, download txt, download json should be moved to the left
7. menu for choosing models should be a drop down
8. choose a different file should be fixed or removed, currently once clicked would remove option to choose model size and file is not cleared.
