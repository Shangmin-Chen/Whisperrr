## Overview

Whisperrr provides a comprehensive set of features for audio transcription powered by Faster Whisper AI. This document outlines all available features and their capabilities.

---

## Core Features

### Instant Transcription

**Description:** Upload audio files and receive transcription results immediately without database setup or job queuing.

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time processing
- Stateless architecture
- No polling required
- Immediate results display

**Use Cases:**
- Quick transcription needs
- One-off audio file processing
- Real-time transcription workflows

---

### High Accuracy Transcription

**Description:** Powered by Faster Whisper AI models with accuracy matching OpenAI Whisper.

**Capabilities:**
- Multiple model sizes (tiny to large-v3)
- Configurable model selection
- High-quality speech recognition
- Automatic language detection

**Model Options:**
- `tiny` - Fastest, basic accuracy
- `base` - Balanced speed and accuracy (default)
- `small` - Better accuracy
- `medium` - High accuracy
- `large` / `large-v2` / `large-v3` - Highest accuracy

**Use Cases:**
- Professional transcription needs
- Content creation
- Accessibility services
- Research and analysis

---

### Segment-Level Timestamping

**Description:** View transcription results with precise start and end timestamps for each segment of transcribed text.

**Capabilities:**
- Precise time alignment for each text segment
- Start and end timestamps in seconds
- Display format: MM:SS (e.g., "00:15 - 00:23")
- Segment view mode in the frontend
- Full text view with segment breakdown

**Technical Details:**
- Timestamps provided in seconds (float precision)
- Frontend displays timestamps in MM:SS format
- Segments include text, start time, end time, and optional confidence scores
- Backend extracts timestamps from Python service response (`start_time` and `end_time` fields)

**Use Cases:**
- Video editing and synchronization
- Creating subtitles and captions
- Audio analysis and annotation
- Content indexing and search
- Educational content with time markers

**Implementation:**
- Python service returns segments with `start_time` and `end_time` fields
- Backend maps these fields to `startTime` and `endTime` in the API response
- Frontend displays timestamps using `formatSegmentTimestamp()` utility function
- Users can toggle between full text view and segmented view with timestamps

---

### Multi-Language Support

**Description:** Support for 99+ languages with automatic detection.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic language detection
- Manual language specification (optional)
- ISO 639-1 language codes
- High accuracy across supported languages

**Use Cases:**
- International content
- Multilingual projects
- Language learning materials
- Global accessibility

---

### Multiple Audio Formats

**Description:** Support for various audio file formats.

**Supported Formats:**
- MP3
- WAV
- M4A
- FLAC
- OGG
- WMA

**Limitations:**
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Audio-only files (no video)

**Use Cases:**
- Various audio sources
- Different recording devices
- Archive audio files
- Podcast transcription

---

### Fast Performance

**Description:** Up to 4x faster than OpenAI Whisper with less memory usage.

**Performance Characteristics:**

- `medium`: ~2x realtime
- `large`: ~1x realtime

**Use Cases:**
- Batch processing
- Real-time transcription needs
- Resource-constrained environments
- High-volume workflows

---

### Modern User Interface

## Feature History

### 2024-01-15: Segment-Level Timestamping

**Added:** Segment-level timestamping feature for precise time alignment of transcription segments.

**Details:**
- Backend updated to correctly extract `start_time` and `end_time` from Python service response
- Frontend displays timestamps in MM:SS format
- Users can view transcriptions in segment view with timestamps
- Fixed field name mapping issue between Python service (snake_case) and backend (camelCase)

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated `AudioServiceImpl.java` to extract `start_time` and `end_time` fields
- Added backward compatibility for `start` and `end` field names
- Frontend `formatSegmentTimestamp()` utility formats timestamps correctly

**Impact:**
- Users can now see precise timestamps for each segment
- Enables video editing, subtitle creation, and content synchronization workflows
- Improves usability for time-sensitive transcription needs

---

## Upcoming Features

### Planned Enhancements

- **Export Options:** Download transcriptions in various formats (SRT, VTT, TXT, JSON)
- **Batch Processing:** Upload and process multiple files simultaneously
- **Confidence Scores:** Display confidence scores for segments and overall transcription
- **Language Selection:** Manual language selection in the UI
- **Model Selection:** UI for selecting Whisper model size
- **Processing History:** Optional history tracking (if database is added)
