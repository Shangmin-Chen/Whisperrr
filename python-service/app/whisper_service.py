"""
WhisperService class for managing OpenAI Whisper models and transcription.

This module provides a comprehensive service layer for managing Whisper model lifecycle
and performing high-quality audio transcription. It implements a singleton pattern to
ensure efficient resource management and provides thread-safe operations for concurrent
transcription requests.

Key Features:
    - Singleton pattern for efficient resource management
    - Thread-safe model loading and transcription operations
    - Asynchronous processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
    - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
    - Performance monitoring and metrics collection
    - Memory management and cleanup
    - Support for all Whisper model sizes
    - Multi-language transcription (99+ languages)

Architecture:
    The WhisperService acts as the core transcription engine, managing:
    - Model loading and caching
    - Audio preprocessing and validation
    - Transcription execution and result formatting
    - Resource cleanup and memory management
    - Performance monitoring and logging

Thread Safety:
    All public methods are thread-safe and can be called concurrently:
    - Model loading uses locks to prevent race conditions
    - Transcription operations are isolated in thread pool
    - Shared state is protected with appropriate synchronization
    - Resource cleanup is coordinated across threads

Performance Optimization:
    - Model caching to avoid repeated loading
    - Efficient memory management with cleanup
    - Configurable concurrency limits
    - Audio preprocessing for optimal quality
    - Performance metrics collection

Error Handling:
    - Custom exception hierarchy for different error types
    - Graceful degradation for recoverable errors
    - Comprehensive logging for debugging
    - Resource cleanup on failures
    - Retry logic for transient failures

class WhisperService:
    """
    Singleton service for managing Whisper models and transcription operations.
    
    This class serves as the central coordinator for all Whisper-related operations
    in the transcription service. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure
    efficient resource usage and provides thread-safe operations for concurrent
    transcription requests.
    
    Core Responsibilities:
        - Model Lifecycle Management: Loading, caching, and unloading Whisper models
        - Transcription Orchestration: Managing the complete transcription pipeline
        - Resource Management: Efficient memory usage and cleanup
        - Concurrency Control: Thread-safe operations with proper synchronization
        - Performance Monitoring: Metrics collection and performance tracking
        - Error Handling: Comprehensive error management and recovery
    
    Singleton Pattern:
        Uses thread-safe singleton implementation to ensure:
        - Single model instance per service
        - Efficient memory usage
        - Consistent state across requests
        - Proper resource cleanup
    
    Thread Safety:
        All public methods are designed for concurrent access:
        - Model loading operations are synchronized
        - Transcription requests are isolated in thread pool
        - Shared state is protected with locks
        - Resource cleanup is coordinated
    
    Model Management:
        Supports all Whisper model sizes:
        - tiny: 39 MB, fastest processing, basic accuracy
        - base: 74 MB, balanced speed/accuracy (default)
        - small: 244 MB, better accuracy, moderate speed
        - medium: 769 MB, high accuracy, slower processing
        - large: 1550 MB, highest accuracy, slowest processing
    
    Performance Features:
        - Model caching to avoid repeated loading
        - Asynchronous processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
        - Configurable concurrency limits
        - Memory usage monitoring
        - Processing time tracking
        - Automatic resource cleanup
    
    Language Support:
        Supports 99+ languages including:
        - Major languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, etc.
        - Regional variants and dialects
        - Automatic language detection
        - Language-specific optimization
    
    Error Recovery:
        - Graceful handling of model loading failures
        - Automatic retry for transient errors
        - Resource cleanup on failures
        - Detailed error reporting
        - Service degradation strategies
    
    Usage Example:
        ```python
        # Get service instance
        service = WhisperService()
        
        # Load model
        await service.load_model("base")
        
        # Transcribe audio
        result = await service.transcribe_audio(
            file_path="audio.mp3",
            language="en"
        )
        
        print(result.text)
        ```
    
    Attributes:
        _instance: Singleton instance reference
        _lock: Thread lock for singleton creation
        _model: Currently loaded Whisper model
        _model_size: Size of currently loaded model

        only once due to the singleton pattern.
        
        Initialization Process:
            1. Check if already initialized (singleton safety)
